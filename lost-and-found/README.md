# FindIt — Lost & Found Platform (React + Node.js)

A multi-organization lost-and-found platform. Any organization (college,
university, hospital, company, etc.) can register; once approved by the
super-admin, its members (students / staff / patients / employees) can create
accounts under that organization and post lost or found items with a photo.
Anyone who finds their item can view the poster's contact info (after
logging in) and reach out directly.

## What's inside

This is a **full-stack** project with 3 parts, matching your 3 requirements:

1. **Main Site** (public) — browse organizations, browse lost/found items,
   post an item, view item details & contact info. Logged-in users get an
   **OLX-style** experience:
   - **My Items** (`/my-items`) — every item a user has posted, with Edit,
     Mark Resolved and Delete actions.
   - **Edit Item** (`/items/:id/edit`) — update title/description/category/
     contact info, replace or remove the photo. Only the original poster
     can edit or delete their own item (enforced on the backend too).
   - **My Profile** (`/profile`) — edit name, phone, bio, address/city/
     state, profile photo, and change password.
   - **Advanced organization search** — every organization has a rich
     profile: description, full address, city, district, state, pincode,
     website and logo. `/organizations` lets a visitor filter by type,
     city, district and state, and free-text search across name +
     description + location, so an organization is easy to find.
   - **Help & Tutorials** (`/help`) — a FAQ covering every part of the
     site (finding an org, signing up, posting/editing items, contact
     visibility, chat, organization dashboard, admin approval), ending
     with a support email for anything else — set via `SUPPORT_EMAIL`
     in the backend `.env`.
   - **Chat with poster** — from any item's detail page, a logged-in
     member can click **Chat with poster** to open a direct, private,
     item-linked conversation with whoever posted it (member-to-member
     only — organizations/admin don't take part). **Messages** in the
     navbar lists every conversation with an unread badge; messages
     refresh automatically every few seconds without needing sockets.

2. **Organization Panel** — register (with description/location/website),
   log in, and get a full dashboard:
   - **Overview** — member/item stat cards + activity charts (lost vs
     found over the last 14 days, open vs resolved split).
   - **Items** — every item posted under the org, with search, category,
     status and date-range filters, sorting, and delete.
   - **Members** — every registered member, searchable by name/email/city.
   - **Organization Profile** — edit description, full address/city/
     district/state/pincode, phone, website, and upload/remove a logo —
     this is exactly what shows up in public search results.

3. **Super Admin Panel** — approve / reject / delete organizations, and:
   - **Overview** — platform-wide stats + growth charts (organizations/
     users/items over 14 days), organizations-by-type breakdown, top
     organizations by items posted, approval-status split.
   - **Organizations** — advanced filters (status, type, city, state,
     free text), click a row to expand full details (email, phone,
     website, full address, description), approve/reject/delete.
   - **Members** — every user on the platform, searchable and filterable
     by organization, with remove.
   - **Items** — every item on the platform, searchable and filterable by
     category/status/organization, for moderation.
2. **Organization Panel** — an organization registers/logs in and gets a
   dashboard: stats, all items posted under it, all its members.
3. **Super Admin Panel** — approve / reject / delete organizations, and see
   platform-wide stats. This is the account that decides which organizations
   go live on the main site.

**Database:** MongoDB (via Mongoose). Collections: `organizations`, `users`,
`items`, `admins`, `conversations`, `messages`. **Photos and logos** are stored in
MongoDB too (`images` collection, max 4MB each) and served at `/uploads/:id`,
so the backend works on read-only hosts like Vercel.

## How the database works

`backend/config/db.js` connects to `MONGODB_URI` (default
`mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/lost_and_found`) and `backend/models/index.js`
defines the Mongoose models. IDs are strings and API responses expose them
as `id`, so the frontend is unchanged. Deleting an organization cascades to
its users, items, photos and chats.

## Setup & run

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+ and MongoDB (local install, Docker
`docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo`, or a free MongoDB Atlas cluster).

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env     # set MONGODB_URI if not using local MongoDB
npm run dev        # or: npm start
```

The server starts on **http://localhost:5000**. On first run it prints a
default super-admin login to the console, e.g.:

```
Default super-admin created -> username: "admin", password: "admin123"
```

Use that to log in at the Admin Panel. Change `ADMIN_DEFAULT_USERNAME/PASSWORD` in `.env` before the very first
run (the admin is seeded only when the `admins` collection is empty).

### 2. Frontend

Open a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens on **http://localhost:5173**. It auto-proxies `/api` and `/uploads`
requests to the backend (see `vite.config.js`), so just run both and use
the frontend URL.

## Typical flow to test everything

1. Go to `/org/register` → register e.g. "ABC College" (type: college).
   It stays **pending**.
2. Go to `/admin/login`, log in with the printed default admin creds.
3. In the Admin Panel, **Approve** "ABC College".
4. Go to `/org/login` and log in as that organization → see its (empty)
   dashboard.
5. Go to `/register` (the main site's user signup) → select "ABC College"
   from the dropdown → create a student/staff account.
6. Log in as that user → click **+ Post Item** → post a lost or found item
   with a photo.
7. Go to `/organizations` → open "ABC College" → see the item in the public
   list. Contact info is hidden until you're logged in.
8. Click **My Items** in the navbar → try **Edit** (change text, swap or
   remove the photo), **Mark Resolved**, and **Delete**.
9. Click **My Profile** → update your name/phone, or change your password.

| GET | `/api/meta` | public | Site metadata (currently: the support contact email for the Help page) |
| POST | `/api/chat/start` | user | Start/resume a conversation about one item with its poster |
| GET | `/api/chat/conversations` | user | My conversations, with unread counts, newest activity first |
| GET | `/api/chat/unread-count` | user | Total unread messages, for the navbar badge |
| GET | `/api/chat/conversations/:id/messages` | user (participant) | A conversation's messages (also marks it read for me) |
| POST | `/api/chat/conversations/:id/messages` | user (participant) | Send a message |

Set `SUPPORT_EMAIL` in `backend/.env` to whatever address you want shown at
the bottom of the Help page for "contact the company".

## Notes / things you can extend later

- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt; sessions use JWT (7-day expiry).
- Contact info on an item is visible to any logged-in account (user, org,
  or admin) — you can tighten this to "same organization only" if you want.
- Users can mark their own item **resolved**; org admins and users can
  delete items (with photo cleanup from the database).
